# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We support the latest tagged release, the release used by ROS 2, and, in practice, treat the development version (`master`) as if it is a release.

Reports of issues for any other versions are equally welcome and we will try to address them properly in the supported versions if they still exist. We may on occasion decide to provide a fix also on an older version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please see the [Eclipse Vulnerability Reporting](https://www.eclipse.org/security/) page for full details on reporting a vulnerability.
