listtopics
==========

Description
***********

The "listtopics" example shows how to monitor which topics have been defined in the
system.

Running the example
*******************

Discovering remote topics is only possible when topic discovery is enabled in the
configuration using:

    <Discovery>
      <EnableTopicDiscoveryEndpoints>true</EnableTopicDiscoveryEndpoints>
    </Discovery>

most applications create some topics and those are always visible, but this example
creates none and so yields no output if there is no discovery of remote topics.

It does make an effort to detect this case by also monitoring the discovery of other
participants.  If any show up but no topics are discovered, it will print a warning.
Running two copies of this program (and nothing) else will always trigger this warning.
