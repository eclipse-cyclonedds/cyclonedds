Building Eclipse Cyclone DDS applications

***********************************
Building the *Hello World!* example
***********************************

To test the :ref:`installation <TestYourInstallation>`, a small
*Hello World!* application is used. This application will also be used
as an introduction to DDS.

This chapter explains how to build this example, without details
regarding the source code. The next chapter will explain what has
to be done to code the *Hello World!* example.

The procedure used to build the *Hello World!* example can also be
used for building your own applications.

:Windows: ...

:Linux: It is advised to have copied the Eclipse Cyclone DDS examples to a user-friendly
  location as described in :ref:`this <CopyLinuxExamplesToUserFriendlyLocation>`
  paragraph when actively building the Eclipse Cyclone DDS examples on Linux.
  This chapter refers to the Eclipse Cyclone DDS examples installed
  in the user-defined location.

Building With CMake
*******************


.. _`CMakeIntro`:

CMake
=====

`CMake <http://cmake.org>`_ is an open-source, cross-platform
family of tools designed to build, test and package software.
CMake is used to control the software compilation process using
simple platform and compiler independent configuration files,
and generate native makefiles and workspaces that can be used
in the compiler environment of your choice.

In other words, CMake's main strength is build portability.
CMake uses the native tools, and other than requiring itself,
does not require any additional tools to be installed. The same
CMake input files will build with GNU make, Visual studio 6,7,8
IDEs, borland make, nmake, and XCode.

An other advantage of CMake is building out-of-source. It simply
works out-of-the-box. There are two important reasons to choose
this:

1. Easy cleanup (no cluttering the source tree). Simply remove
   the build directory if you want to start from scratch.
2. Multiple build targets. It's possible to have up-to-date
   Debug and Release targets, without having to recompile the
   entire tree. For systems that do cross-platform compilation,
   it is easy to have up-to-date builds for the host and target
   platform.

There are a few other benefits to CMake, but that is out of the
scope of this document.

.. _`CycloneDdsPackage`:

Hello World! CMake (CycloneDDS Package)
=======================================

Specifying how to build the *Hello World!* example requires only a few
lines of configuration in :code:`examples/helloworld/CMakeLists.txt`

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/helloworld/CMakeLists.txt
    :linenos:
    :language: cmake

It will try to find the :code:`CycloneDDS` CMake package. When it
has found it, every path and dependencies are automatically set.
After that, an application can use it without fuss. CMake will
look in the default locations for the code:`CycloneDDS` package.

.. _`IdlcGenerate`:

The :code:`CycloneDDS` package provides the :code:`ddsc` library that
contains the DDS API that the application needs. It also provides a
component "idlc" that provides helper functionality for generating
library targets from IDL files (:code:`idlc_generate`). These library
targets can be easily used when compiling an application that depends on
a data type described in an IDL file.

Two applications will be created, :code:`HelloworldPublisher`
and :code:`HelloworldSubscriber`. Both consist only out of one
source file.

Both applications need to be linked to the :code:`ddsc` library
in the :code:`CycloneDDS` package and :code:`HelloWorldData_lib`
that was generated by the call to :code:`idlc_generate`.


.. _`HelloWorldBuilding`:

Hello World! Configuration
==========================

The *Hello World!* example is prepared to be built by CMake
through the use of its :code:`CMakeLists.txt` file. The first
step is letting CMake configure the build environment.

It's good practice to build examples or applications
out-of-source. In order to do that, create a :code:`build`
directory in the :code:`examples/helloworld` directory and go
there, making our location :code:`examples/helloworld/build`.

Here, we can let CMake configure the build environment for
us by typing:
::

    cmake ..

.. note::
    CMake does a pretty good job at guessing which generator to use, but some
    environments require that you supply a specific generator. For example, only
    64-bit libraries are shipped for Windows, but CMake will generate a 32-bit
    project by default, resulting in linker errors. When generating a
    Visual Studio project keep in mind to append **Win64** to the generator.
    The example below shows how to generate a Visual Studio 2015 project.
    ::

        cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" ..

.. note::
    CMake generators can also create IDE environments. For instance,
    the "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" will generate a Visual Studio
    solution file. Other IDE's are also possible, like Eclipse.

CMake will use the CMakeLists.txt in the helloworld directory
to create makefiles that fit the native platform.

Since everything is prepared, we can actually build the
applications (HelloworldPublisher and HelloworldSubscriber in
this case).


Hello World! Build
==================

After the configuration step, building the example is as easy
as typing:
::

    cmake --build .

.. note::
    On Windows, it is likely that you have to supply the config
    of Visual Studio:
    ::

        cmake --build . --config "Release"

while being in the build directory created during the
configuration step: :code:`examples/helloworld/build`.

The resulting Publisher and Subscriber applications can be found
in:

:Windows:  :code:`examples\helloworld\build\Release`.
:Linux: :code:`examples/helloworld/build`.

The *Hello World!* example can now be executed,
like described in :ref:`Test your installation <TestYourInstallation>`,
using the binaries that were just build. Be sure to use the right directories.


*******
Summary
*******

We've seen that a Eclipse Cyclone DDS application can be build by using a Makefile on Linux
or a Visual Studio Solutions on Windows. Also CMake can be used to build a Eclipse Cyclone DDS
application. In fact, it is the preferred way of building.

In the end, a predefined way of generating and building the source code should
be followed when building Eclipse Cyclone DDS applications. The figure below shows how a
typical Eclipse Cyclone DDS application is build.
