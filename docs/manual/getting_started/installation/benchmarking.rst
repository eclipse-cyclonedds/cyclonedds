Benchmarking Tools
##################

The |var-project-short| ``ddsperf`` tool primarily measures data *throughput*
and *latency* of the DDS applications within a network, or within the same board. 
The ``ddsperf`` tool also helps to do sanity checks that ensure your configuration 
is correctly set up and running. 

In addition to ``ddsperf``, there are dedicated :ref:`examples_bm` that show how to measure
the DDS system throughput and the latency with their associated codebase. You can start 
from the provided code and customize it to fit your requirements. Both the ``ddsperf`` 
tool and the examples perform the benchmarking using sequences of octets with different 
parameterized sizes.

.. important::

    The ``throughput`` and ``latency`` examples are not suitable as general DDS 
    benchmarking tools as they sacrifice performance for simplicity. You cannot compare
    test results from these tools with results from other tools.


Measuring latency
=================

To measure latency between two different applications, you run
two instances of the ``ddsperf`` tool. The first instance has
the role of a *sender* that sends a given amount of data (a sequence of
octets) at a given rate. The second instance has the role of
*receiver* that sends back the same amount of data to the sender in a
Ping-Pong scenario. The sending action is triggered by the **Ping**
option. The receiving behavior is triggered by the **Pong** action. The
sender measures the roundtrip time and computes the latency as half of
the roundtrip time.

The Ping-Pong scenario avoids clock desynchronization issues that can
occur between two machines that do not accurately share the same
perception of the time in the network.

To differentiate  the two operational modes, the ``ddsperf`` tool can
operate either in a **Ping mode** or in a **Pong mode**. 

To run the Ping-Pong scenario (with default values):

1. Open two terminals (for example, on Linux-like OSs). 
2. In the first terminal, run the following command: 
  
 .. code-block:: console

    ddsperf ping

3. In the second terminal run the following command:

 .. code-block:: console

    ddsperf pong

To customize the test scenario, you can change the following options:

* In **Ping mode** you can specify:

  * The **Rate** and frequency at which data is written. This is
    specified through the [R[Hz]] option. The default rate is "as fast as
    possible". In **ping** mode, it always sends a new ping as soon as it
    gets a pong.

  * The **Size** of the data that is exchanged. This is specified
    through the [Size S] option. Using the built-in default topic, 12 bytes 
    (an integer key, an integer sequence number, and an empty sequence of bytes) 
    are sent every time. The size is "as small as possible" by default, 
    depending on the default topic size.

  * The **Listening** mode, which can either be ``waitset`` based or
    ``Listener`` Callbacks modes. In the waitset mode, the ``ddsperf``
    application creates a dedicated thread to wait for the data to return
    back from the receiving instance of ``ddsperf`` tool (that is, the instance
    started with the Pong mode). In the Listener Callback mode, the
    thread is created by the |var-project| middleware. The Listener mode is
    the default.

* In **Pong mode**,you can only specify one option:

  * The **Listening** mode (with two possible values, ``waitset`` or
    ``Listener``)

For example, to measure local latency between to processes exchanging 2KB 
at the frequency of 50Hz: 

1. Open two terminals. 
2. In the first terminal, run the following command: 

 .. code-block:: console

    ddsperf ping 50Hz 2048 waitset

3. In the second terminal run the following command:

 .. code-block:: console

    ddsperf pong waitset

The output of the ``ddsperf`` tool is as shown below:

- The output for the **Ping** application:

  .. image:: /_static/gettingstarted-figures/4.3-2.png

 - The **size of the data** involved in the test (For example, 12 bytes)
 - The **minimum latency** (For example, 78.89 us)
 - The **maximum latency** (For example, 544,85 us)
 - The **mean latency** (For example, 118.434 us)
 - As well as the latency at 50%, 90%, or 99% of the time.

- The output for the **Pong** application:

  .. image:: /_static/gettingstarted-figures/4.3-3.png

 - **RSS** is the Resident Set Size; it indicates the amount of memory
    used by the process (For example, 3.5MB used by the process ID 2680).
 - **VCSW** is the number of voluntary switches, it indicates the
   times when the process waits for input or an event (For example, 2097 times).
 - **IVCSW** is the number of involuntary switches, it indicates the
   times when the process is pre-empted or blocked by a mutex (For example, 6
   times).
 - The percentage of time spent executing user code and the percentage
   of time spent executing the kernel code in a specific thread (For example, spent
   almost 0% of the time executing the user code and 5% executing kernel
   code in thread "ping").


Measuring throughput
====================

To measure throughput between two different applications, run at least two instances of 
the ``ddsperf`` tool. One terminal acts as a Publisher that sends a set amount of data
(a sequence of octets) at a set rate. The other instances act as Subscriber applications. 

.. note::
 When your scenario involves only one subscriber, the UDP unicast mode is used. 
 If several subscriber instances are running, the multicast is automatically used.

.. image:: /_static/gettingstarted-figures/4.4-1.png

Two additional modes are supported:

The **Pub** mode and the **Sub** mode.

In the Sub mode, the subscriber operates in one of the following ways:

- **Listener** notifications. Receives a notification each time a new set of data is 
  added to the subscriber's cache.
- **WaitSet** notifications. Receives a notification whenever the conditions of a 
  WaitSet are met. For further information, refer to :ref:`waitset_conditions`.
- **Pooling** mode. The subscriber cyclically fetches the data from its local cache.

There are two ways to publish each data sample; individually, or by sending them in 
*Burst* mode. The following are the parameters for *Burst* mode:

- The **Rate** and frequency at which data is written (defined by the [R[Hz]] option). 
  The default rate is "as fast as possible". In **pub** mode, instead of trying to 
  reach a set rate, it sends data as fast as possible.
- The **Size** of the data that is exchanged (defined by the [Size S] option). 
  The default size is "as small as possible" (depending on the size of the topic).
- The **Burst Size** (only applies to the **pub** mode) is the number of data samples 
  issued together as a batch (defined by the [Burst N] option). The default size for burst is 1. 
  Note: When going "as fast as possible", this option does not make any difference.
- The default triggering mode is *listener* for the **ping** , **pong** and **sub** mode.

To run a simple throughput test (with default values): 

1. Open two terminals. 
2. In the first terminal, run the following command:

 .. code-block:: console

    ddsperf pub size 1k

3. In the second terminal run the following command:

 .. code-block:: console

    ddsperf -Qrss:1 sub

This test measures the throughput of data samples with 1Kbytes written as
fast as possible.

The ``-Qrss:1`` option in **sub** mode sets the maximum allowed an increase
in RSS as 1MB. When running the test, if the memory occupied by the
process increases by less than 1MB, the test can successfully run.
Otherwise, an error message is printed out at the end of the test.

As the ``pub`` in this example only has a size of 1k, the sub does not
print out an RSS error message at the end of the test.

The output of the ``ddsperf`` tool when measuring throughput is as shown
below:

- The output for the **Pub** application:
  
  .. image:: /_static/gettingstarted-figures/4.4-2.png

 - **RSS** is the Resident Set Size; it indicates the amount of memory
   used by the process (For example, 6.3MB used by the process ID "4026");
 - **VCSW** is the number of voluntary switches, it indicates the
   times when the process waits for input or an event (For example, 1054 times);
 - **IVCSW** is the number of involuntary switches, it indicates the
   times when the process is pre-empted or blocked by a mutex (For example, 24
   times);
 - The percentage of time spent executing user code and the percentage
   of time spent executing kernel code in a specific thread (For example, spent
   34% of the time executing the user code and 11% executing kernel code
   in thread "pub").


- The output for the **Sub** application:

  .. image:: /_static/gettingstarted-figures/4.4-3.png

 - The **size of the data** involved in this test (For example, 1024 bytes,
   which is the "size 1k" defined in the pub command).
 - The **total packets received** (For example, 614598).
 - The **total packets lost** (For example, 0).
 - The **packets received in a 1 second reporting period** (For example,
   212648).
 - The **packets lost in a 1 second report period** (For example, 0).
 - The **number of samples processed by the Sub application** in 1s
   (For example, 21260 KS/s, with the unit KS/s is 1000 samples per second).


Measuring Throughput and Latency in a mixed scenario
====================================================

In some scenarios, it can be useful to measure the throughput and
latency at the same time.

The ``ddsperf`` tool allows you to mix these two scenarios. 
The Ping mode can be combined with the Pub mode to address such cases.

The [Ping x%] switch combined with the Pub mode allows you to send a
fraction of samples x% as if they were used in the Ping mode.

The different modes of the ``ddsperf`` tool are summarized in the figure
below.

To get more information for the ``ddsperf`` tool, use the [help] option:

.. code-block:: console

    ddsperf help

Additional options
==================

As well as selecting the ``mode``, you can also select the ``options``
to specify how to send and receive the data (such as modifying the
reliable QoS from Reliable to Best-Effort with the ``-u`` option), or
how to evaluate or view the data in the ``ddsperf``\ tool.

The ``options`` you can select are listed in the ``ddsperf`` ``help``
menu, as shown below.
