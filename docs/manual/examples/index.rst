.. note::
    |var-project| has various configuration parameters and comes with a default built-in
    configuration. To run an example, or any application that uses |var-project| for its data
    exchange, this default configuration is usually sufficient and no further action is required. 
    If you need to change the configuration, refer to the :ref:`Configuration guide<config-docs>`.
