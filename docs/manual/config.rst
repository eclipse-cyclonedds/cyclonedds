Eclipse Cyclone DDS Configuration Options
#########################################

This document attempts to provide background information that will help in adjusting the
configuration of Eclipse Cyclone DDS when the default settings do not give the desired behavior.
A full listing of all settings is out of scope for this document, but can be extracted
from the sources.

The configuration guide is broken down into two parts: A high level description of the :ref:`DDSI Concepts` where the user can learn about the generic DDSI concepts, and a separate
section that goes through the Eclipse Cyclone specifics.

Users that are already familiar with the concepts of DDS can go directly to the :ref:`Eclipse Cyclone DDS Specifics`, to learn how to configure Eclipse Cyclone DDS.
