This tutorial describes how to write a single message. To publish anything to DDS it 
is necessary to first define the type of message. 

.. note::
    In order to talk to other applications that are not necessarily running Python, 
    use the IDL compiler.

To manually define a message type in Python using the ``cyclonedds.idl`` tools:

.. code-block:: python3
    :linenos:

    from dataclasses import dataclass
    from cyclonedds.idl import IdlStruct

    @dataclass
    class Message(IdlStruct):
        text: str


    name = input("What is your name? ")
    message = Message(text=f"{name} has started his first DDS Python application!")

With ``cyclonedds.idl`` write typed classes with the standard library module 
`dataclasses <python:dataclasses>`. For this simple application, the data being 
transmitted only contains a piece of text, but this system has the same expressive 
power as the OMG IDL specification, allowing you to use almost any complex datastructure.

To send your message over a DDS domain, carry out the following steps:

1. Join the DDS network using a DomainParticipant
2. Define which data type and under what name you will publish your message as a topic
3. Create the ``DataWriter`` that publishes that Topic
4. And finally, publish the message.


.. code-block:: python3
    :linenos:

    from cyclonedds.topic import Topic
    from cyclonedds.pub import DataWriter

    participant = DomainParticipant()
    topic = Topic(participant, "Announcements", Message)
    writer = DataWriter(participant, topic)

    writer.write(message)

You have now published your first message successfully! However, it is hard to tell 
if that did anything since we don't have anything set up to listen for incoming 
messages. Let's make a second script that takes messages from DDS and prints them 
to the terminal:

.. code-block:: python3
    :linenos:

    from dataclasses import dataclass
    from cyclonedds.domain import DomainParticipant
    from cyclonedds.topic import Topic
    from cyclonedds.sub import DataReader
    from cyclonedds.util import duration
    from cyclonedds.idl import IdlStruct

    @dataclass
    class Message(IdlStruct):
        text: str

    participant = DomainParticipant()
    topic = Topic(participant, "Announcements", Message)
    reader = DataReader(participant, topic)

    # If we don't receive a single announcement for five minutes, we want the script to exit.
    for msg in reader.take_iter(timeout=duration(minutes=5)):
        print(msg.text)

Now with this script running in a second terminal, you should see the message pop up 
when you rerun the first script.
