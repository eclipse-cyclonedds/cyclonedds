DDSI concepts
#############

The |url::ddsi_spec| is related to the |url::dds_spec|, with a clear
correspondence between the entities in DDSI and those in DCPS. However, this
correspondence is not one-to-one.

To help explain where the DDSI specification ends and the |var-project| implementation 
begins, this section provides a high-level description of the concepts of the DDSI
specification, with few references to the specifics of the |var-project|
implementation.
