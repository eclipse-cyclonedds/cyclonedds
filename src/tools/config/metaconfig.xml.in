                    This element specifies the domain Id of the instantiated DDS domain. If several different DDS domains are required to run
                    simultaneously, then they all need to have their own unique domain Id.
                    Note - for maximum interoperability it is recommended that you only select a domain Id from the range 0 &lt;= n &lt;= 230. The domain Id
                    value is used by the DDSI2 service to derive values for the required network communiction endpoints and service reconfiguration is
                    required to use domain id values outside of this range. The special value "any" takes the domain id from the domain argument of the dds_create_participant operation.
                    Please see section 9.6.1 of the Real-time Publish-Subscribe Wire Protocol DDS Interoperability Wire Protocol specification (DDSI), v2.1, formal/2009-01-05 at

<p>This element describes the DiffServ setting the channel will apply to the networking messages. This parameter determines the value of the diffserv field of the IP version 4 packets sent on this channel which allows QoS setting to be applied to the network traffic send on this channel.<br/>
Windows platform support for setting the diffserv field is dependent on the OS version.<br/>
For Windows versions XP SP2 and 2003 to use the diffserv field the following parameter should be added to the register:<br/><br>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\TcpIp\Parameters\DisableUserTOSSetting<br/><br/>
The type of this parameter is a DWORD and its value should be set to 0 to allow setting of the diffserv field.<br/><br/>
For Windows version 7 or higher a new API (qWAVE) has been introduced. For these platforms the specified diffserv value is mapped to one of the support traffic types.
The mapping is as follows: 1-8 background traffic; 9-40 excellent traffic; 41-55 audio/video traffic; 56 voice traffic; 57-63 control traffic.
When an application is run without Administrative priveleges then only the diffserv value of 0, 8, 40 or 56 is allowed.</p>

<p>The CipherKey attribute is used to define the secret key required by the cipher selected using the Cipher attribute. The value can be a URI referencing an external file containing the secret key, or the secret key can be defined in-place as a string value.</p>
<p>The key must be specified as a hexadecimal string with each character representing 4 bits of the key. E.g., 1ABC represents the 16-bit key 0001 1010 1011 1100. The key should not follow a well-known pattern and must exactly match the key length of the selected cipher.</p>
<p>A malformed key will cause the security profile to be marked as invalid, and disable all network partitions secured by the (invalid) security profile to prevent information leaks.</p>
<p>As all DDS applications require read access to the XML configuration file, for security reasons it is recommended to store the secret key in an external file in the file system, referenced by its URI. The file should be protected against read and write access from other users on the host.</p>
