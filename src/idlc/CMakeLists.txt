# Maven is executed within the idlc directory located in the build directory
# and generated sources are stored in idlc/target. Non-generated sources,
# however, do not reside in the build directory and Maven must be instructed
# to use those. To allow maven to be executed from both the source and build
# directories (idlc may be moved to it's own repository), the pom.xml file is
# pulled through the configure_file function with basedir set to the original
# source directory. It is a cute little hack to avoid having to use different
# profiles etc.
