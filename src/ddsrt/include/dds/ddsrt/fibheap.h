/** @file fibheap.h
  The main purpose of a fibonacci heap is for use as a priority queue i.e. repeatedly extracting the minimum of the set.
  Certain operations i.e. insert, merge, decrease_key are very efficient in that they have O(1) time complexity,
  but they they degrade the shape of the heap, which requires rebalancing to fix.
  The necessary rebalancing is delayed until the next call to extract_min.

  For example, after lots of calls to insert and/or decrease_key, the next call to extract_min is very expensive
  since it has to rebalance, and this could take as much as O(N) in the worst case. This is where you pay off the debt
  for procrastinating on rebalancing. Once balanced, following calls to extract_min will be O(log(N)).

/// @brief The fibheap node is the basic element of the fibonacci heap.
/// 
/// - children: Rather than have a pointer to each child, it has one pointer to a representative child.
///   The other children can then be reached through the child's prev/next.
/// - prev/next: Siblings form a circular doubly linked list, so all can be reached going either direction.
///   A node without siblings will point prev/next to itself.
/// - mark: Is either 0 (unmarked) or 1 (marked). It is marked to indicate the node has lost a child since the last time
///   it was made the child of another node. Newly created nodes are unmarked.
///   A node becomes unmarked whenever it is made the child of another node.
///   The mark flag is of importance for @ref ddsrt_fibheap_decrease_key and @ref ddsrt_fibheap_delete.
///
