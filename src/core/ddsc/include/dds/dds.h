/**
 * @brief Enable entity.
 * @ingroup entity
 * @component generic_entity
 *
 * @note Delayed entity enabling is not supported yet (CHAM-96).
 *
 * This operation enables the dds_entity_t. Created dds_entity_t objects can start in
 * either an enabled or disabled state. This is controlled by the value of the
 * entityfactory policy on the corresponding parent entity for the given
 * entity. Enabled entities are immediately activated at creation time meaning
 * all their immutable QoS settings can no longer be changed. Disabled Entities are not
 * yet activated, so it is still possible to change their immutable QoS settings. However,
 * once activated the immutable QoS settings can no longer be changed.
 * Creating disabled entities can make sense when the creator of the DDS_Entity
 * does not yet know which QoS settings to apply, thus allowing another piece of code
 * to set the QoS later on.
 *
 * The default setting of DDS_EntityFactoryQosPolicy is such that, by default,
 * entities are created in an enabled state so that it is not necessary to explicitly call
 * dds_enable on newly-created entities.
 *
 * The dds_enable operation produces the same results no matter how
 * many times it is performed. Calling dds_enable on an already
 * enabled DDS_Entity returns DDS_RETCODE_OK and has no effect.
 *
 * If an Entity has not yet been enabled, the only operations that can be invoked
 * on it are: the ones to set, get or copy the QosPolicy settings, the ones that set
 * (or get) the Listener, the ones that get the Status and the dds_get_status_changes
 * operation (although the status of a disabled entity never changes). Other operations
 * will return the error DDS_RETCODE_NOT_ENABLED.
 *
 * Entities created with a parent that is disabled, are created disabled regardless of
 * the setting of the entityfactory policy.
 *
 * If the entityfactory policy has autoenable_created_entities
 * set to TRUE, the dds_enable operation on the parent will
 * automatically enable all child entities created with the parent.
 *
 * The Listeners associated with an Entity are not called until the
 * Entity is enabled. Conditions associated with an Entity that
 * is not enabled are "inactive", that is, have a trigger_value which is FALSE.

 * words, all related callbacks are replaced (possibly with NULL).

 * possible WaitSet trigger.

 * @ingroup reading

 *
 * Reads samples from the reader history cache without marking these samples as "read". It starts
 * with an arbitrary (matching) instance, reading (matching) samples from the oldest to
 * the most recent, then continues with another arbitrarily selected (matching) instance,
 * etc. This continues until it has traversed the entire history cache or has gathered
 * `maxs` samples.
 *
 * The @ref dds_read operation can be used to mark the returned samples as "read"; the
 * @ref dds_take operation can be used to also remove the returned samples from the
 * history cache.
 *
 * For the plain `dds_peek` operation, all instances and samples match. This is different
 * for the more selective variants, where the documentation refers to this function and
 * only gives detailed information where it differs.
 *
 * The `buf` parameter is used as follows:
 * - If `buf[0]` on entry is a null pointer:
 *   - on return `buf[0]` .. `buf[k-1]` will point to middleware-owned memory (a.k.a. loans); and
 *   - `buf[k]` will be a null pointer if `0 <= k < bufsz`; and
 *   - `0 <= k <= maxs` is the number of samples read (a.k.a. the return value).
 *
 * - If `buf[0]` on entry is an outstanding sample loan (i.e., resulting from a previous call to, e.g., read), then:
 *   - all of `buf[0]` .. `buf[k-1]` must be pointers to outstanding loans; and
 *   - `k` = `bufsz` or `buf[k]` is a null pointer; where
 *   - `1 <= k < bufsz`; and
 *   - all these outstanding loans are returned as-if through @ref dds_return_loan; and
 *   - the result will be as if `buf[0]` had been a null pointer on entry.
 *
 * - If `buf[0]` on entry is any other address, then:
 *   - all of `buf[0]` .. `buf[bufsz-1]` must point to memory suitable for storing samples; and
 *   - the C binding requires that this memory must be initialized such that all embedded strings, externals,
 *     optionals and sequences are initialized (null pointers are ok, sequences may also be all-0)
 *
 * The loans returned by `dds_peek` operation are potentially shared copies of the data and the contents
 * may not be modified. If a private copy is required, pass in non-null pointers to memory as in the third case
 * above.
 *
 * The `si` array is filled with sample information on all returned samples. If the
 * `valid_data` flag is set in the sample info for a particular sample, all fields of that
 * sample are valid. Otherwise, only the key value is valid. For the C binding, all other
 * fields will be set to 0.
 *

 * @param[in,out] buf An array of  `bufsz` pointers to samples (see above).
 * @param[out] si Pointer to an array of @ref dds_sample_info_t returned for each data value.
 * @param[in] bufsz The size of buffer provided.
 * @param[in] maxs Maximum number of samples to read.

/**
 * @brief Read data from the data reader, read or query condition
 * @ingroup reading
 * @component read_data
 *
 * Reads samples from the reader history cache, marking these samples as "read". It starts
 * with an arbitrary (matching) instance, reading (matching) samples from the oldest to
 * the most recent, then continues with another arbitrarily selected (matching) instance,
 * etc. This continues until it has traversed the entire history cache or has gathered
 * `maxs` samples.
 *
 * The @ref dds_peek operation can be read samples without marking them as "read"; the
 * @ref dds_take operation can be used to also remove the returned samples from the
 * history cache.
 *
 * For the plain `dds_read` operation, all instances and samples match. This is different
 * for the more selective variants, where the documentation refers to this function and
 * only gives detailed information where it differs.
 *
 * The `buf` parameter is used as follows:
 * - If `buf[0]` on entry is a null pointer:
 *   - on return `buf[0]` .. `buf[k-1]` will point to middleware-owned memory (a.k.a. loans); and
 *   - `buf[k]` will be a null pointer if `0 <= k < bufsz`; and
 *   - `0 <= k <= maxs` is the number of samples read (a.k.a. the return value).
 *
 * - If `buf[0]` on entry is an outstanding sample loan (i.e., resulting from a previous call to, e.g., read), then:
 *   - all of `buf[0]` .. `buf[k-1]` must be pointers to outstanding loans; and
 *   - `k` = `bufsz` or `buf[k]` is a null pointer; where
 *   - `1 <= k < bufsz`; and
 *   - all these outstanding loans are returned as-if through @ref dds_return_loan; and
 *   - the result will be as if `buf[0]` had been a null pointer on entry.
 *
 * - If `buf[0]` on entry is any other address, then:
 *   - all of `buf[0]` .. `buf[bufsz-1]` must point to memory suitable for storing samples; and
 *   - the C binding requires that this memory must be initialized such that all embedded strings, externals,
 *     optionals and sequences are initialized (null pointers are ok, sequences may also be all-0)
 *
 * The loans returned by `dds_read` operation are potentially shared copies of the data and the contents
 * may not be modified. If a private copy is required, pass in non-null pointers to memory as in the third case
 * above.
 *
 * The `si` array is filled with sample information on all returned samples. If the
 * `valid_data` flag is set in the sample info for a particular sample, all fields of that
 * sample are valid. Otherwise, only the key value is valid. For the C binding, all other
 * fields will be set to 0.
 *
 * @param[in] reader_or_condition Reader, readcondition or querycondition entity.
 * @param[in,out] buf An array of  `bufsz` pointers to samples (see above).
 * @param[out] si Pointer to an array of @ref dds_sample_info_t returned for each data value.

 * @brief Take data from the data reader, read or query condition
 * @ingroup reading
 * @component read_data
 *
 * Reads and removes samples from the reader history cache. It starts with an arbitrary
 * (matching) instance, reading (matching) samples from the oldest to the most recent,
 * then continues with another arbitrarily selected (matching) instance, etc. This
 * continues until it has traversed the entire history cache or has gathered `maxs`
 * samples.
 *
 * The @ref dds_read operation can be used to read samples without removing them from
 * the history cache but marking them as "read"; the @ref dds_peek operation can be used
 * to read samples from the cache without changing any internal state.
 *
 * For the plain `dds_take` operation, all instances and samples match. This is different
 * for the more selective variants, where the documentation refers to this function and
 * only gives detailed information where it differs.
 *
 * The `buf` parameter is used as follows:
 * - If `buf[0]` on entry is a null pointer:
 *   - on return `buf[0]` .. `buf[k-1]` will point to middleware-owned memory (a.k.a. loans); and
 *   - `buf[k]` will be a null pointer if `0 <= k < bufsz`; and
 *   - `0 <= k <= maxs` is the number of samples read (a.k.a. the return value).
 *
 * - If `buf[0]` on entry is an outstanding sample loan (i.e., resulting from a previous call to, e.g., read), then:
 *   - all of `buf[0]` .. `buf[k-1]` must be pointers to outstanding loans; and
 *   - `k` = `bufsz` or `buf[k]` is a null pointer; where
 *   - `1 <= k < bufsz`; and
 *   - all these outstanding loans are returned as-if through @ref dds_return_loan; and
 *   - the result will be as if `buf[0]` had been a null pointer on entry.
 *
 * - If `buf[0]` on entry is any other address, then:
 *   - all of `buf[0]` .. `buf[bufsz-1]` must point to memory suitable for storing samples; and
 *   - the C binding requires that this memory must be initialized such that all embedded strings, externals,
 *     optionals and sequences are initialized (null pointers are ok, sequences may also be all-0)
 *
 * The loans returned by `dds_take` operation are potentially shared copies of the data and the contents
 * may not be modified. If a private copy is required, pass in non-null pointers to memory as in the third case
 * above.
 *
 * The `si` array is filled with sample information on all returned samples. If the
 * `valid_data` flag is set in the sample info for a particular sample, all fields of that
 * sample are valid. Otherwise, only the key value is valid. For the C binding, all other
 * fields will be set to 0.
