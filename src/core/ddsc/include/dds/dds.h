/**
 * @brief Enable entity.
 * @ingroup entity
 * @component generic_entity
 *
 * @note Delayed entity enabling is not supported yet (CHAM-96).
 *
 * This operation enables the dds_entity_t. Created dds_entity_t objects can start in
 * either an enabled or disabled state. This is controlled by the value of the
 * entityfactory policy on the corresponding parent entity for the given
 * entity. Enabled entities are immediately activated at creation time meaning
 * all their immutable QoS settings can no longer be changed. Disabled Entities are not
 * yet activated, so it is still possible to change their immutable QoS settings. However,
 * once activated the immutable QoS settings can no longer be changed.
 * Creating disabled entities can make sense when the creator of the DDS_Entity
 * does not yet know which QoS settings to apply, thus allowing another piece of code
 * to set the QoS later on.
 *
 * The default setting of DDS_EntityFactoryQosPolicy is such that, by default,
 * entities are created in an enabled state so that it is not necessary to explicitly call
 * dds_enable on newly-created entities.
 *
 * The dds_enable operation produces the same results no matter how
 * many times it is performed. Calling dds_enable on an already
 * enabled DDS_Entity returns DDS_RETCODE_OK and has no effect.
 *
 * If an Entity has not yet been enabled, the only operations that can be invoked
 * on it are: the ones to set, get or copy the QosPolicy settings, the ones that set
 * (or get) the Listener, the ones that get the Status and the dds_get_status_changes
 * operation (although the status of a disabled entity never changes). Other operations
 * will return the error DDS_RETCODE_NOT_ENABLED.
 *
 * Entities created with a parent that is disabled, are created disabled regardless of
 * the setting of the entityfactory policy.
 *
 * If the entityfactory policy has autoenable_created_entities
 * set to TRUE, the dds_enable operation on the parent will
 * automatically enable all child entities created with the parent.
 *
 * The Listeners associated with an Entity are not called until the
 * Entity is enabled. Conditions associated with an Entity that
 * is not enabled are "inactive", that is, have a trigger_value which is FALSE.
