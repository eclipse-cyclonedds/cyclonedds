/**
 * @brief Enable entity.
 *
 * @note Delayed entity enabling is not supported yet (CHAM-96).
 *
 * This operation enables the dds_entity_t. Created dds_entity_t objects can start in
 * either an enabled or disabled state. This is controlled by the value of the
 * entityfactory policy on the corresponding parent entity for the given
 * entity. Enabled entities are immediately activated at creation time meaning
 * all their immutable QoS settings can no longer be changed. Disabled Entities are not
 * yet activated, so it is still possible to change their immutable QoS settings. However,
 * once activated the immutable QoS settings can no longer be changed.
 * Creating disabled entities can make sense when the creator of the DDS_Entity
 * does not yet know which QoS settings to apply, thus allowing another piece of code
 * to set the QoS later on.
 *
 * The default setting of DDS_EntityFactoryQosPolicy is such that, by default,
 * entities are created in an enabled state so that it is not necessary to explicitly call
 * dds_enable on newly-created entities.
 *
 * The dds_enable operation produces the same results no matter how
 * many times it is performed. Calling dds_enable on an already
 * enabled DDS_Entity returns DDS_RETCODE_OK and has no effect.
 *
 * If an Entity has not yet been enabled, the only operations that can be invoked
 * on it are: the ones to set, get or copy the QosPolicy settings, the ones that set
 * (or get) the Listener, the ones that get the Status and the dds_get_status_changes
 * operation (although the status of a disabled entity never changes). Other operations
 * will return the error DDS_RETCODE_NOT_ENABLED.
 *
 * Entities created with a parent that is disabled, are created disabled regardless of
 * the setting of the entityfactory policy.
 *
 * Calling dds_enable on an Entity whose parent is not enabled
 * will fail and return DDS_RETCODE_PRECONDITION_NOT_MET.
 *
 * If the entityfactory policy has autoenable_created_entities
 * set to TRUE, the dds_enable operation on the parent will
 * automatically enable all child entities created with the parent.
 *
 * The Listeners associated with an Entity are not called until the
 * Entity is enabled. Conditions associated with an Entity that

 * <b><i>Communication Status</i></b><br>
 * For each communication status, the StatusChangedFlag flag is initially set to
 * FALSE. It becomes TRUE whenever that plain communication status changes. For
 * each plain communication status activated in the mask, the associated
 * Listener callback is invoked and the communication status is reset
 * to FALSE, as the listener implicitly accesses the status which is passed as a
 * parameter to that operation.
 * The status is reset prior to calling the listener, so if the application calls
 * the get_<status_name> from inside the listener it will see the
 * status already reset.
 *
 * <b><i>Status Propagation</i></b><br>
 * In case a related callback within the Listener is not set, the Listener of
 * the Parent entity is called recursively, until a Listener with the appropriate
 * callback set has been found and called. This allows the application to set
 * (for instance) a default behaviour in the Listener of the containing Publisher
 * and a DataWriter specific behaviour when needed. In case the callback is not
 * set in the Publishers' Listener either, the communication status will be
 * propagated to the Listener of the DomainParticipant of the containing
 * DomainParticipant. In case the callback is not set in the DomainParticipants'
 * Listener either, the Communication Status flag will be set, resulting in a
 * possible WaitSet trigger.

 * the number of triggered entities. It is possible that the given size
 * of the list is not the same as the number of triggered entities. If less

 * latter case is undefined.
 *
 * In case of a time out, the return value is 0.

 *
 * An empty waitset never triggers (i.e., dds_waitset_wait on an empty
