/*
 * Short working ponderings.
 *
 * A handle will be created with a related object. If you want to protect that object by
 * means of a mutex, it's your responsibility, not handleservers'.
 *
 * The handle server keeps an 'active claim' count. Every time a handle is claimed, the
 * count is increase and decreased when the handle is released. A handle can only be
 * deleted when there's no more active claim. You can use this to make sure that nobody
 * is using the handle anymore, which should mean that nobody is using the related object
 * anymore. So, when you can delete the handle, you can safely delete the related object.
 *
 * To prevent new claims (f.i. when you want to delete the handle), you can close the
 * handle. This will not remove any information within the handleserver, it just prevents
 * new claims. The delete will actually free handleserver internal memory.
 *
 * There's currently a global lock in the handle server that is used with every API call.
 * Maybe the internals can be improved to circumvent the need for that...

 * The lookup of an handle should be very quick.
 * But to increase the performance just a little bit more, it is possible to
 * acquire a handlelink. This can be used by the handleserver to circumvent
 * the lookup and go straight to the handle related information.
 *
 * Almost every handleserver function supports the handlelink. You don't have
 * to provide the link. When it is NULL, the normal lookup will be done.
 *
 * This handlelink is invalid after the related handle is deleted and should
