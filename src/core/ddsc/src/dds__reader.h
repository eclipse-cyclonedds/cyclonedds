  dds_reader_lock_samples: Returns number of samples in read cache and locks the
  reader cache to make sure that the samples content doesn't change.
  Because the cache is locked, you should be able to read/take without having to
  lock first. This is done by passing the DDS_READ_WITHOUT_LOCK value to the
  read/take call as maxs. Then the read/take will not lock but still unlock.

  See also CHAM-287, CHAM-306 and LITE-1183.

  Used to support LENGTH_UNLIMITED in C++.
